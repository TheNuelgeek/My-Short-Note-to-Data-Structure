# **MY SHORT NOTE TO DATA STRUCTURE**
## **Author: [Nuelgeek](https://twitter.com/theNuelgeek) | Software Engr | Smart Contract Developer**

--------------------

**ABOUT :** 
- This note will contain a summary of different data structures, algorithms, and some implementation on typescript. These contents are notes I made up from Data structure classes from Frontend masters.

**AIM :** 
- This note is to help you with snippet of data structure and algorithms meanings and how it works.
  
- It can be useful for preparation of job interview without the hassle of reading voluminous information.

- Looking for straight forward contents on Data structure, this is for you.

# *! Let's Gooooooooooo*


## What is Data Structure ?
Data structures frame the organization of information so that machines and humans can better understand it.

## What is Alogrithm ?
Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.

## WHat is Big O ?
Big O is a way to categorize your algorithms time or memory requirements based on input. It is not meant to be an exact measurement. It will not tell you how many CPU cycles it takes, instead it is meant to generalize the growth of your algorithm.

## Important Concepts
1.  Growth is with respect to the input
2.  Constants are dropped
3.  Worst case is usually the way we measure

# SEARCH

   - **Linear search** is an alorithm technique, where you must traverse through the array's index to obtain a value. 
that is measurable in O(N) . [typescript implementation](https://github.com/TheNuelgeek/Data-Structure-Algorthim-kata-machine/blob/master/src/day1/LinearSearchList.ts)
   - A form of search method called **binary search** involves halving the size of an ordered dataset until the target value is located. Measured in
O(logN) or O(NlogN). [typescript implementation](https://github.com/TheNuelgeek/Data-Structure-Algorthim-kata-machine/blob/master/src/day1/BinarySearchList.ts)

# SORT
-  **Bubble sort** is a type of algorithm where a single iteration produces the largest number (data) at the last index till the dataset is sorted. The next iteration won’t include the last index. It is measured in O(N^2). [typescript implementation](https://github.com/TheNuelgeek/Data-Structure-Algorthim-kata-machine/blob/master/src/day1/BubbleSort.ts)
-  **A linked list** is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. Runtime is O(1). 
-  **A Queue** is a specific implementation of a linked list where there is no Bi link to the Node, which is denoted as FIFO (First In First Out) operation. The runtime is N(1). [typescript implementation](https://github.com/TheNuelgeek/Data-Structure-Algorthim-kata-machine/blob/master/src/day1/Queue.ts)
-  **A Stack** is a single-Linked list where we get to add to it and remove from the head, denoted as FILO (First In Last Out). Runtime is O(1). [typescript implementation](https://github.com/TheNuelgeek/Data-Structure-Algorthim-kata-machine/blob/master/src/day1/Stack.ts)

# ARRAY

- **Array vs Linked list**
  
| Array | Linked list |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1. Access to Indices | Indices don’t exist in the list. |
| 2. It is O(1) when you want to write into an array. | It is O(1) when you want to insert into a list | 
| 3. You have to allocate the memory of your array up front, even if you’re not aware of the memory length needed.  | Memory are created instantly when data is added to the node, but it costs a runtime to create the memory. | 
| 4. You have options for search methods in your array. E.g. Binary Search etc  | Linear search is your only option when you want to search for data in your list. |

- **ArrayList** uses the array as the fundament base to perform extra operations on it like Resizing, Pushing, Popping etc. Array list is time-consuming using Enqueue/Dequeue and fast with Push/Pop.[typescript implementation](https://github.com/TheNuelgeek/Data-Structure-Algorthim-kata-machine/blob/master/src/array-test.ts)
- **Array Buffer**, is used when there is some uncertainty about the amount of data or the rate of arrival of the data that will be placed there.
